        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An ontology of information objects, encodings and realizations, as a plugin to DOLCE-Ultralite (reusing mainly the dul:expresses and dul:realizes relations from it). 
Several patterns are contained inside this ontology:
- encodings of information entities
- kinds of realizations (gestural motions, depictions, digital, multimedia, speech, etc.)
- combinatorial relations between information objects
- relations between formal expressions and generalized expressions (lexicalizations, formalizations)
- relations between formal expressions and their assignments in formal semantics
- relations between information objects and schemata (data structures, KOS, etc.)
- authorship
- kinds of linguistic objects
- copies, reproductions, etc.
- cultural combination of information objects (reuse, mixing, metaphorical blending)</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology.
It is a simplification of some parts of the DOLCE Lite-Plus library (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DLP397.owl). 
Main aspects in which DOLCE+DnS Ultralite departs from DOLCE Lite-Plus are the following:

- The names of classes and relations have been made more intuitive
- The DnS-related part is closer to the newer &apos;constructive DnS&apos; ontology (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/cDnS.owl).
- Temporal and spatial relations are simplified
- Qualities and regions are more relaxed than in DOLCE-Full: they can be used as attributes of any entity; an axiom states that each quality has a region
- Axiomatization makes use of simpler constructs than DOLCE Lite-Plus
- The architecture of the ontology is pattern-based, which means that DOLCE+DnS Ultralite is also available in modules, called &apos;content ontology design patterns&apos;, which can be applied independently in the design of domain ontologies (cf. http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org).  If many modules are needed in a same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version.

The final result is a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social contexts.
Several extensions of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite have been designed: 
- Information objects: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl 
- Systems: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/SystemsLite.owl 
- Plans: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/PlansLite.owl
- Legal domain: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/CLO/CoreLegal.owl
- Lexical and semiotic domains: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L2.owl
- DOLCE-Zero: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/d0.owl is a commonsense-oriented generalisation of some top-level classes, which allows to use DOLCE with tolerance against ambiguities like abstract vs. concrete information, locations vs. physical artifacts, event occurrences vs. event types, events vs. situations, qualities vs. regions, etc.; etc.</rdfs:comment>

        <owl:versionInfo rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Created by Aldo Gangemi as both a simplification and extension of DOLCE and Descriptions and Situations ontologies.</owl:versionInfo>
        <owl:versionInfo rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In 1.8, all object properties have been aligned to associatedWith, and some comments have been added.
In 1.7, the encodes object property has been modified in order to support any kind of information entity (purely social object or realization), and to give justice to computer science pragmatic equivalence between information objects that are fully encoded for computing, and the actual bits travelling in a machine or network, based on that encoding. The realizes property has been consequenctly declared as a subproperty of encodes.
Also removed redundant owl:someValuesFrom axioms
In 1.6, broadened range of hasRepresentationLanguage
In 1.5, some fixes added wrt to new plugins (Roles.owl, CollectionsLite.owl).
In 1.4, all elements have got English labels. Added the class LinguisticAct, useful to relate Agent(s) when use information objects to express meaning with some CommunicativeFunction (from the theory by Jakobson). Moreover, the relation between formal patterns and information patterns have been enriched. Some bugs fixed.</owl:versionInfo>
        <owl:versionInfo rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In 3.2, the links between instances of Region or Parameter, and datatypes have been revised and made more powerful, in order to support efficient design patterns for data value modelling in OWL1.0.
Also, the names of the related properties have been changed in order to make them more intuitive.
Furthermore, a large comment field has been added to the &apos;expresses&apos; object property, in order to clarify some issues about the many interpretations.
In 3.3, the relation between regions, parameters, and datatypes has been still improved.
In 3.5, the person-related classes have been refactored: Person in 3.4 is now SocialPerson, to avoid confusion with commonsense intuition; Person is now the union of social persons and humans, therefore being a subclass of Agent.
In 3.6, other fixes on universal restriction involving expresses. Also added the property &apos;isConstraintFor&apos; between parameters and entities. Moved the properties: &apos;assumes&apos; and &apos;adopts&apos; to the new module: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/Conceptualization.owl.
In 3.7, some fixes on the names of classes and properties related to FormalEntity; created a new separate module for general universal restrictions (DULGCI.owl).
In 3.8, more fixes on the interface to formal entities and links to IOLite.owl.
In 3.9, some naming and comment fixes.
In 3.10, removed cardinality restriction from hasPart and isPartOf restrictions (changed to hasComponent and isComponentOf), for OWL(DL) compatibility. Also enlarged the range of includesAgent to contain both social and physical agents, and of conceptualizes universal restriction on agents, to include all social objects.
In 3.11, some more subproperty axioms have been introduced, and all elements have got English labels.
In 3.12, added some classes to map some old DolceLitePlus classes that were used to align OntoWordNet.
In 3.13, added the LocalConcept class to express a Concept that cannot be used in a Description different from the one that defines it. Also updated some comments.
In 3.14, added some comments.
In 3.15, removed some owl:disjointWith axioms relating Collection to InformationObject, Description, Situation, and SocialAgent. The rationale for doing that is to allow less strict constraints on domain relations involving collections that can be also conceived as descriptions, situations, social agents, or information objects; for example: a collection of sentences from a text (an information object) that are ranked with a relevance criterion can be still considered a text.
In 3.16, name of isActedBy changed to actsThrough, which is clearer. Also added SpatioTemporalRegion as constituted by a SpaceRegion and a TimeInterval.
In 3.17, removed redundant universal axioms from Entity and other top classes. Fixed restrictions on FunctionalSubstance class, and comments in Design and Substance classes.
In 3.18, removed subClassOf axiom from FunctionalSubstance to DesignedArtifact, created a new subclass of FunctionalSubstance, called DesignedSubstance, and created a subClassOf axiom from DesignedSubstance to DesignedArtifact.
In 3.19, removed disjointness axiom between Concept and Collection (the same rationale applies as in 3.15 version.
In 3.20, revised the comment for Quality, added InformationEntity as the superclass for InformationObject and InformationRealization (represented as the union of those classes). This is needed in many domain ontologies that do not need to distinguish between abstract and concrete aspects of information entities. One possible revision (not implemented here) would be to introduce the relations: expresses and isAbout with a broader domain:InformationEntity, and two more specific properties: abstractlyExpresses and isAbstractlyAbout. This last revision has not been implemented yet, since a large revision procedure should be carried out in order to check the impact of the revision on the existing DOLCE-DnS-Ultralite plugins.
In 3.21, added comment to InformationEntity, and optimized representation of equivalence for InformationRealization.
In 3.22, added comment to Personification.
In 3.23, added associatedWith object property, and put all object properties as subproperties of it.
In 3.24, removed hasProxy datatype property.
In 3.25, generalized domain and range of hasComponent and isComponentOf.
In 3.26, updated some comments in order to clarify or exemplify the concepts.
In 3.27, added rdfs:isDefinedBy annotations for Linked Data browsers.
In 3.28, broadened the universe of pre-/post-conditions to give room to events and states.
In 3.29, added some properties to support DBpedia alignment: sameSettingAs (situational analogous to coparticipation), including relations originating e.g. from sharing kinship, ownership, or roleplaying situations.
In 3.30, completed some domains and ranges (formerly owl:Thing, now dul:Entity), and added axiom: Organism subClassOf PhysicalAgent.
In 3.31, added a restriction to Quality and one to Region in order to ensure the original DOLCE constraint of qualities being always associated with a region, and vice versa. These axioms do not however exclude a direct applicability of qualities or regions to any other entity.
In 3.32, removed redundant union axioms and some restrictions, which spot a negative trade-off between expressivity and complexity.
In 3.33, added the ObjectAggregate class, added two property chains for coparticipation and same situation setting, updated some comments, added an axiom to Transition.
In 3.34, extended mereological support for parthood, introducing hasPropertPart (transitive) as a middle property between hasPart (transitive and reflexive) and hasComponent (asymmetric). This solution uses then &quot;reflexive reduction&quot; and &quot;transitive reduction&quot; design patterns (they allow to grant property characteristics through the superproperties, but not in the subproperties). Technically, mereology axioms would require that also hasProperPart be asymmetric, however a direct subproperty of an OWL non-simple property (hasPart) cannot be also asymmetric, hence the approximation. 
Added a n-ary parthood class in order to suggest an alternative pattern for time- (and space-)indexed part relations. In order to ensure that property characteristics hold also with parthood n-ary, a property chain is introduced which infers a direct dul:partOf property for each parthood individual.
Added a dul:realizesSelfInformation propery in order to enable local reflexivity (&apos;Self&apos;) axioms for all information realizations.

In 4.0, some foundational changes are introduced. 
- Firstly, the temporally indexed versions of some properties are introduced as subclasses of Situation (following the n-ary relation pattern), so covering relations from DOLCE that were skipped because of their larger arity. - 
- Secondly, D&amp;S&apos;s Situation class is extracted from DOLCE top-level distinctions (it used to be a subclass of SocialObject), put as a primitive class under Entity, and not disjoint from any other class. Since we are relaxing the semantics of Situation, this change is fully compatible with previous versions of DUL.
The reason for the change is that it may sound counterintuitive (as many have noticed) to assume a descriptive commitment for situations, but not for events or states. 
In fact, D&amp;S provides an epistemological commitment to an ontology, independently from its foundational distinctions. A situation operationalizes that epistemology, and it is better not to put it under any foundational distinction (event, object, fluent, etc.), leaving to the designer whether to use descriptions as epistemological lenses, and so generating a situation, or not. 
A consequence is that any entity, when &apos;framed&apos; by (satisfying) a description, becomes a situation. We can still model entities as being in a situation&apos;s setting, and classified by a concept defined in a description.</owl:versionInfo>

A style recommendation for usage guidelines is that they should be brief. In contrast to usual concept annotations that can, and should be detailed about the reasons behind modelling decisions, usage guidelines are simply meant to answer questions about when it is appropriate to use a concept, and they must be a practical, easy to query and understand resource.</rdfs:comment>

The relation is defined with domain and range of maximum generality, as it is possible to construe containment to apply between Events, between Objects, between Qualities and so on. Care should be taken when using it that the construal of containment makes sense and is useful. If a clearer relation expresses the connection between two Entities, use that relation instead. For example, rather than saying an Event contains an Object, it is probably better to say the Event has that Object as a participant. More specific versions of this relation exist, e.g. containsEvent, so it is likely that there will be few situations where it should be used itself. However, by acting as a superproperty to several relations, it captures a core similarity between these and enables taxonomy-based similarity metrics.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This is a large comment field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the &apos;expresses&apos; relation for modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.
For example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:

- Beehive means &quot;a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box.&quot; (Oxford dictionary)
- &apos;Beehive&apos; is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 &quot;beehive|hive&quot; (WordNet)
- &apos;the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of &apos;being a beehive&apos;, i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.&apos;
- &apos;the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas&apos;
- &apos;the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive&apos;
- &apos;&apos;Beehive&apos; for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen&apos;
- &apos;Your meaning of &apos;Beautiful&apos; does not seem to fit mine&apos;
- &apos;&apos;Beehive&apos; is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives&apos;
- &apos;from the term &apos;Beehive&apos;, we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it&apos;
- the lexeme &apos;Belly&apos; expresses the role &apos;Body_Part&apos; in the frame &apos;ObservableBodyParts&apos; (FrameNet)

As the examples suggest, the &apos;meaning of meaning&apos; is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. 
However, the usefulness of having a &apos;semantic abstraction&apos; in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. 
We provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the &apos;expresses&apos; relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.

In the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or &apos;gloss&apos;, or &apos;definition&apos;). 
Another approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a &apos;concept&apos;, encoded as a &apos;lemma&apos;, &apos;synset&apos;, or &apos;descriptor&apos;.
Still another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. 
A radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.
Another approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.
The logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of &apos;Ali&apos; is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of &apos;Airplane&apos; is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. 
Finally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of &apos;Airplane&apos; is situated e.g. in the context (&apos;frame&apos;) of passenger airline flights.

These different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called &apos;semantics&apos;. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):

(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)
	- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as &apos;paraphrases&apos;
	- Conceptual meaning (as for &apos;concept scheme&apos; semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept
	- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description
	- Cognitive meaning (as for &apos;psychological&apos; semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)
	- Cultural meaning (as for &apos;social science&apos; semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)
	- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)

(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between &apos;expresses&apos; and &apos;isAbout&apos;, which can be used interchangeably)
	- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl
	- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld

This is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of &apos;expresses&apos;, so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate.</rdfs:comment>

For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological &apos;strata&apos; (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. 
Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.
A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.</rdfs:comment>

Parthood should assume the basic properties of mereology: transitivity, antisymmetry, and reflexivity (propert Parthood of course misses reflexivity). 
However, antisymmetry is not supported in OWL2 explicitly, therefore DUL has to adopt one of two patterns:
1) dropping asymmetry axioms, while granting reflexivity: this means that symmetry is not enforced, but permitted for the case of reflexivity. Of course, in this way we cannot prevent symmetric usages of hasPart;
2) dropping the reflexivity axiom, and enforce asymmetry: in this case, we would prevent all symmetric usages, but we loose the possibility of enforcing reflexivity, which is commonsensical in parthood.
In DUL, we adopt pattern #1 for partOf, and pattern #2 for properPartOf, which seems a good approximation: due to the lack of inheritance of property characteristics, each asymmetric hasPropertPart assertion would also be a reflexive hasPart assertion (reflexive reduction design pattern).

Subproperties and restrictions can be used to specialize hasPart for objects, events, etc.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A relation between an information object and an Entity (including information objects). It can be used to talk about entities that are references of proper nouns: the proper noun &apos;Leonardo da Vinci&apos; isAbout the Person Leonardo da Vinci; as well as to talk about sets of entities that can be described by a common noun: the common noun &apos;person&apos; isAbout the set of all persons in a domain of discourse, which can be represented in DOLCE-Ultralite as an individual of the class: dul:Collection.
A specific sentence may use common nouns with either a singular or plural reference, or it can even refer to all possible references (e.g. in a lexicographic definition): all those uses are kinds of aboutness.

The isAbout relation is sometimes considered as reflexive, however this is semiotically inaccurate, because information can be about itself (&apos;de dicto&apos; usage, as in &apos;John is four character long&apos;), but it is typically about something else (&apos;de re&apos; usage, as in &apos;John loves Mary&apos;).
If a reflexivity exists in general, it rather concerns its realisation, which is always associated with an event, e.g. an utterance, which makes the information denoting itself, besides its aboutness. This is implemented in DUL with the dul:realizesSelfInformation property, which is used with local reflexivity in the dul:InformationRealization class.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">&apos;Constituency&apos; depends on some layering of  the world described by the ontology. For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological &apos;strata&apos; (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. 
Intuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.
A desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.
Example of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. 
In all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it.</rdfs:comment>

It mainly represents the subsumption relation between e.g. a Concept or Description and another Concept (resp. Description) that is broader in extensional interpretation, but narrower in intensional interpretation. For example, the role PhDStudent specializes the role Student.
Another possible use is between a Collection that isCoveredBy a Concept A, and another Collection that isCoveredBy a Concept B that on its turm specializes A. For example, the 70,000 series Selmer Mark VI saxophone Collection specializes the Selmer Mark VI saxophone Collection.</rdfs:comment>

It is often the case that shapes need to be altered from their description in a shape file, and a typical example of this is scaling a mesh. 

In robotics, it is not uncommon to encounter shapes that are flipped compared to the shape in a mesh file. This is because robots often have bilateral symmetry, thus it makes sense to reuse the same meshes for corresponding links of the left and right arms.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A datatype property that encodes values from a datatype for an Entity. 
There are several ways to encode values in DOLCE (Ultralite):

1) Directly assert an xsd:_ value to an Entity by using hasDataValue
2) Assert a Region for an Entity by using hasRegion, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
3) Assert a Quality for an Entity by using hasQuality, then assert a Region for that Quality, and assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue
4) When the value is required, but not directly observed, assert a Parameter for an xsd:_ value by using hasParameterDataValue, and then associate the Parameter to an Entity by using isConstraintFor
5) When the value is required, but not directly observed, you can also assert a Parameter for a Region by using parametrizes, and then assert an xsd:_ value to that Region, by using hasRegionDataValue

The five approaches obey different requirements. 
For example, a simple value can be easily asserted by using pattern (1), but if one needs to assert an interval between two values, a Region should be introduced to materialize that interval, as pattern (2) suggests. 
Furthermore, if one needs to distinguish the individual Quality of a value, e.g. the particular nature of the density of a substance, pattern (3) can be used. 
Patterns (4) and (5) should be used instead when a constraint or a selection is modeled, independently from the actual observation of values in the real world.</rdfs:comment>

For example, a Parameter MinimumAgeForDriving hasParameterDataValue 18 on datatype xsd:int, in the Italian traffic code. In this example, MinimumAgeForDriving isDefinedIn the Norm ItalianTrafficCodeAgeDriving.
More complex parametrization requires workarounds. E.g. AgeRangeForDrugUsage could parametrize data value: 14 to 50 on the datatype: xsd:int. Since complex datatypes are not allowed in OWL1.0, a solution to this can only work by creating two &apos;sub-parameters&apos;: MinimumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 14) and MaximumAgeForDrugUsage (that hasParameterDataValue 50), which are components of (cf. hasComponent) the main Parameter AgeRangeForDrugUsage.
Ordering on subparameters can be created by using or specializing the object property &apos;precedes&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>An Event for which causes are unknown and/or considered irrelevant. This is true also for &quot;final causes&quot; (that is, intentions) of Agents participating in the Accident: it is not the intentions of these Agents to bring about the Accident.

Note a distinction between this definition and some informal, everyday uses of &quot;accident&quot; which require a causal structure and responsibility to be ascertained. An accident, in the informal sense, may require an explanation as to who made a mistake in bringing about the event; a &quot;traffic accident&quot;, where we want to know who&apos;s responsible, is an example of this.

Such an event does NOT fall under the definition of Accident here. An example of Accident would be a fair coin landing Heads: the causal chain for why this exact face landed is not important, all that matters is the brute fact that the coin landed Heads.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>also think about &quot;mistakes&quot;: (Mihai:) yes, but consider whether those might qualify as Situations. Likewise for Accidents, actually.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Tasks where the goal is to move an object.

Usually, an agent will use their prehensile effectors, ie. hands, for this purpose, so there is a lot of conceptual overlap between Actuating and Manipulating.

However, these categories are nonetheless distinguished in that there are more ways to actuate objects than simply manipulating them; for example, some tool like a net or frying pan might be used to catch an object.

Another way to look at the difference between Actuating and Manipulating is in what they &quot;profile&quot;, ie. focus on as important.

For Actuating, it is the object&apos;s motion that is paramount.

For Manipulating, it is the movement of the hand(s) and the change in functional relationships (such as kinematic control) between the hand(s) and the manipulated object(s).</rdfs:comment>

Aesthetics is the philosophical study of beauty and taste. The term stems from the Greek word &apos;aisthetikos&apos;, meaning &apos;of sense perception&apos;, and is related to the study of sensory values. From design point of view, aesthetics refers to the visual attractiveness of an object. Visual aesthetics have these key elements: Color, Shape, Pattern, Line, Texture, Visual weight, Balance, Scale, Proximity and Movement.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Relation between Roles/Parameters and their fillers that holds in a particular descriptive context, such as a Workflow or Narrative.

It covers two conceptually related, but somewhat ontologically distinct situations:

-- a binding between two Roles, or two Parameters, with the meaning that in the particular descriptive context where the Binding holds, a filler for one Role/Parameter is also a filler for the other
-- a binding between a Role/Parameter and an Entity able to fill that Role/Parameter, with the meaning that in the particular descriptive context where the Binding holds, the Entity fills the Role/Parameter.

Note: in the second case, the Entity filling the Role/Parameter may be a Role or Parameter itself. This however does NOT reduce to the first case. Consider these examples:

-- (first situation) The accountant is also the lawyer. In this case, there are two roles, and there is a person filling both of them. This is a factual, role-role binding.
-- (second situation, linking to a generic Entity) The accountant is Bob. In this case, there is a factual, role-filler binding asserting who fills the accountant role.
-- (second situation, linking to a role) The newly opened job is accountant. In this case, there is a factual, role-filler binding asserting that some role is filled by another, without making any assertion about the filler of this second role. It is not known, and not important, whether an accountant exists at this time.

There is a further, orthogonal distinction made between:
-- factual: the Binding is asserted to hold in the descriptive context
-- counterfactual: the Binding is used to express conditions in the descriptive context. A counterfactual Binding is not meant as an assertion that the Binding actually holds.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A role that appears in communication tasks, and indicates what the communication is about.

CommunicationTopic can only classify a Social object that participates in an Action that is classified as (the execution of) a CommunicationTask.

Note that classifies here is used in the plays-role sense. This isn&apos;t to say that the social object, ie the information exchanged in the communication, is an instance of the topic. Rather, the topic role refers to what the information is about.

For example, if the topic of a communication is flowers, this does not mean the words themselves are flowers, merely that, in some sense, they are about flowers.</rdfs:comment>

The condition is a conjunction of CounterfactualBindings. These bindings may be RoleRoleBindings (meaning, test whether the fillers for these Roles/Parameters are the same) or RoleFillerBindings (meaning, test whether the filler of the Role unifies with the candidate Entity).

An empty conjunction of CounterfactualBindings is assumed to be True.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A description of a State. This includes e.g. what acceptable regions for participant objects of the State might look like.
A configuration of the world is construed to be stable on its own. Outside disturbances may cause state transitions, and the settling into some other, self-stable configuration.

Several other Description subclasses may function as Configurations. For example, a Goal is a description of a desired State. A Norm describes a State that should be maintained. A Diagnosis describes a State that causes certain symptoms etc.

Note a couple of issues here. First one relates to what &quot;configuration&quot; means; in particular, this doesn&apos;t mean a configuration that is unchanging according to any viewpoint. The analogy here is the &quot;macrostate&quot; from thermodynamics: a macrostate with two gases mixed does not mean all gas particles are motionless, but rather that the locations and movements of gas particles are such that any particle is likely to have as many neighbors of one type as the other.

The second issue relates to what is &quot;outside&quot;. The state is a configuration of some, but not necessarily all, Entities in the world. Entities not in this configuration are outside of it.</rdfs:comment>

-- that two roles share a filler (RoleRoleBindings);
-- that the filler of a role is a particular entity (RoleFillerBindings). This is typically the case when the filler of the role may be one of a few constants, as is the case with the execution status of a robot task.

TODO: for the robot workflows we are likely to need at the start, testing equality of fillers is enough. In the future, we may want to replace that with unifiability of fillers.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A process by which a physical Entity changes its shape under the influence of some factors outside of the Entity.

Note, changes of shape may be self-caused; for example, a gas will naturally disperse. This however would be a different type of process (Dispersion).

A soft slab of clay deforming under its own weight on Earth would still count as deformation: it is the gravity of the Earth (so, a factor outside the slab of clay) which makes the slab change shape.</rdfs:comment>

Note, most of the physical Entities we are concerned with are actually arrangements of many smaller physical Entities, so another way to look at this is that a &apos;Physical destruction&apos; is a process by which an arrangement of physical Entities, which was previously itself considered a physical Entity, is changed to such an extent that it is no longer recognized as continuing to exist.</rdfs:comment>

&apos;Dropping&apos; is intentional. Dropping by accident may not has a phase to release the grasp. It could be that the grasp was not strong enough and the objects &quot;slips&quot; away.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A schematic theory that describes the existence of an entity.

Developmental psychology posits that &quot;object permanence&quot; (the assumption that physical objects keep existing even when the agent doesn&apos;t perceive them, which consequently informs reasoning about where an object should be, even when perception of it is lost) is a cognitive ability that is not, at least in the very young human child, immediately manifest. Rather, it seems learned via interaction, and usually is among an infant&apos;s cognitive repertoire by age 2.

In SOMA, we represent this ability of a cognitive agent as an ability to generate and maintain ESTSchemaTheories. Each instance of such a theory refers to one particular physical object, the one that the instance of the ESTSchemaTheory asserts to exist.

Because each instance of an ESTSchemaTheory refers to a single object, ESTSchemaTheories are not associated to any relation between OWL individuals.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Also known as &quot;executing schemas&quot; or &quot;x-schemas&quot;, these were defined by Bergen and Chang in their work &quot;Embodied Construction Grammar in Simulation-Based Language Understanding&quot; as:

&quot;Executing schemas, or x-schemas, are dynamic representations motivated in part by motor and perceptual systems (Bailey 1997; Narayanan 1997), on the assumption that the same underlying representations used for executing and perceiving an action are brought to bear in understanding language about that action. The x-schema formalism is an extension of Petri nets (Murata 1989) that can model sequential, concurrent, and
asynchronous events&quot;

SOMA does not restrict the formalism of ExecutableSchematicTheories; i.e. they don&apos;t have to be Petri Nets.

They maintain their role however as representations able to drive a simulation, at some level of abstraction, of an embodied action. This level of abstraction may be still fairly underspecified as in the case of the original x-schemas and as such not a plan that an agent could run in an actual physical environment without further information.</rdfs:comment>

An issue to highlight here is the maintenance of constitution. Fluids-- gases in particular-- are prone to disperse. Such a process is not flow however, because the loose bounds between the constituents become even looser, to the point of the original Entity becoming entirely discombobulated. </rdfs:comment>

Image schemas are considered as fundamental, pre-conceptual, building blocks of cognition. They were introduced to characterize how human beings are believed to organize and make sense of experience.

For SOMA, whereas the focus of executable schematic theories is to describe how an agent might act, image schematic theories focus on descriptions of how objects behave in the absence of, or after, an active intervention from an agent.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A task in which the Agent endeavors to accumulate confidence in some general statement about the world, by gathering instances in which this general statement appears to apply. Note that perfect confidence can never be guaranteed by induction.

Induction is often described as a move from many &quot;specifics&quot; (swan A is white, swan B is white, swan C is white, ...) to the &quot;general&quot; (all swans are white).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Tasks where the goal is to move the prehensile effectors, ie. hands, of an agent so as to achieve some spatial or functional relation with some manipulated object. 

Spatial relations refer to positioning the hands in certain ways relative to the manipulated object, for example nearing or distancing them, or aligning them with some relevant axis.

Functional relations here refer to interactions between the hands and manipulated object which constrain the possible behavior of the object. Examples of functional relations in manipulation are support and kinematic control.

Note that manipulation tasks are usually performed with the intention of moving an object in some way, so there is a large conceptual overlap between Manipulating and Actuating.

However these concepts are nonetheless distinguished in what they &quot;profile&quot;, ie. what they focus on as particularly important.

Actuating profiles the movement of the object itself.

Manipulating profiles the movement of the hands and the functional relations, such as kinematic control, they establish with the manipulated object.

Note: we employ Manipulating here in its literal, original sense, of using hands for some purpose, and not in the metaphorical sense of exerting psychological pressure on someone.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>An Event construed as the Agent participant affecting Entities that are representations of actual or potential Entities or Events in the physical world in which the Agent is embodied. These representations are maintained by the Agent participant in the &apos;Mental action&apos; event.

One could argue Mental actions are all Physical actions, because anything the Agent may use to maintain such representations will be physical things, However, we make this distinction because for Mental actions it is less important to consider the physical support of the representation and how it changes, and more important to track how the information content of the representation changes.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Situation which does not manifest in any event.

The main use case for this is to represent expectations that are not met, e.g. unfulfilled post-conditions of an action. An action with unmet postconditions is then a failure.

Because of open world semantics of DL, the default assumption for a Situation individual with no &quot;manifests in&quot; relations is simply that we don&apos;t know yet whether that Situation is manifested and if so by what Event.

As such, an explicit assertion is needed to make a Situation a nonmanifested one: either declare that individual&apos;s type NonmanifestedSituation, or assert that it has 0 manifestsIn relations.</rdfs:comment>

In all these cases, the metaphor points to the existence of several regions of qualitatively different behavior (unimpeded passage of solid grains vs deadlock in a corridor; problem instances where the answer NO is trivial to prove vs. problem instances where the answer YES is trivial to prove), separated fairly sharply when some quantity reaches a threshold.</rdfs:seeAlso>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An image schematic theory that describes a qualitative spatial relation indicating relative proximity, as expressed by the prepositions &apos;near&apos;, &apos;close to&apos;, &apos;next to&apos;, etc.

It may seem that proximity is a very simple notion, requiring no sophisticated theoretical underpinnings. However, proximity is an extremely object- and purpose-dependent relation. A store next door is in a closeness relation to a person, and so is the Sun in the sky, despite the physical distances being different by several orders of magnitude.

As such, a theory, i.e. a description of what a particular kind of closeness means and in which contexts it applies, is necessary.

Adopted from GUM-4-space (Bateman et al. 2010).

Let xL, xR be objects filling the locatum, relatum roles of this schema. Then one can infer that xL &apos;near to&apos; xR.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Mental task in which an Agent endeavours to obtain new knowledge from knowledge it already possesses.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>todo: a taxonomy of reasoning is not trivial. Classical theory distinguishes Deductive, Inductive, and with a stretch Abductive reasoning. However, modern practice distinguishes other categories that overlap with these, e.g. Probabilistic and Non-monotonic.

Both Abductive and Inductive inference may, and often do, use Probabilistic methods. Probabilistic inference is, by its nature, most opposed to Deductive inference which, classically, requires logical certainty.

Any of the Abductive/Deductive/Inductive triad can be further affected by the Monotone/Non-monotone distinction. There are preferences (Inductive and Abductive reasoning is probably most often non-monotonic; most of Deductive reasoning is probably done in monotonic formalisms), but it is certainly the case that, e.g., non-monotone Deduction is possible.

Note, this classification has nothing to do with reasoning domain (e.g. SpatialReasoning, TemporalReasoning, ...) and merely with techniques/logical-mathematical underpinnings.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A State which describes how Agents relate to each other.

One can argue that any Social state is a Physical state, since anything the Agents may use to construct a social relationship is made of physical things. The difference is that the physical support of the social relationships is not important here, what matters instead is the nature and content of the social relations, regardless of how they are physically realized.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>Note here a distinction: the Agents involved must be able to communicate. This is because while it is often assumed that an Agent has or aspires to have similar cognitive capacities to a human, This need not be the case; in particular, not all Agents need to maintain theories of mind about each other and therefore not all Agents need to communicate with each other. It is hard to see what sort of meaning Social concepts might have to such Agents, since Social concepts are all about shared constructions.

Note also that the DUL SocialAgent class is not an appropriate restriction however. SocialAgent is one that exists by agreement of PhysicalAgents. For example, a corporation or a nation are SocialAgents. An Agent with the capability to engage socially is not necessarily a DUL SocialAgent.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>States are stative and homeomeric events.

For stative events, the mereological sum of two instances has the same type as both instances. This is, for example, the state of sitting on a chair, or the process of a pendulum swinging around.

The difference between states and processes is that states are, in addition, homeomeric, and processes are not.  This means that, when considering time slices  of an event, for states, these time slices always have the same type as the state, but for processes this is not the case.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A relation that holds in some descriptive context such as a Workflow, between two TaskInvocations belonging to that same Workflow. It means that one task invocation should follow the other.

Note: a successor relation implemented as an OWL object property is sometimes enough, but not in general; in particular, when there are conditions imposed on the succession.

As a result, a reification pattern was applied here.</rdfs:comment>
        <rdfs:comment>Note: it is possible for a Succedence relation to exist between a TaskInvocation and itself; in this case, both the hasPredecessor and hasSuccessor roles are filled by the same TaskInvocation individual.

Care must be taken with this however, as a natural interpretation of this situation is an infinite loop.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An image schematic theory that describes the reified functional relation holding between two spatial objects x and y, such that x physically supports y in the presence of gravity; x and y need not be in contact. An example of such an expression is &quot;The bowl is on the table&quot;.

This is also known as FunctionalControlExternal in GUM (Bateman et al. 2010).

Let xL, xR be objects filling the locatum, relatum roles of this schema. Then one can infer that xL isSupportedBy xR.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Objects may undergo changes during Processes; however, while the change Process is in operation, one cannot strictly say either the input of the Process still exists, nor that the result exists yet.

A prototypical example is making a pancake on a heater. When PancakeMix is put on the hot plate, it ceases to be PancakeMix-- already, the chemical structure of the substance gets altered-- however it is only after sufficient heating that this object becomes a Pancake.

Transients are the objects undergoing such change processes; they are no longer the initial objects fed into the process, nor are they the objects produced as results.

Instead, a Transient transitionsFrom some initial Object that was fed into a change Process. Typically, a Transient may transitionTo some resulting Object (though not always, some processes simply destroy objects).

It is also possible that a Transient transitionsBack to the initial object. An example is the catalyst in a chemical reaction; another example is a loaf of bread after a slice has been cut off.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A SocialAgent that is actedBy agents that are (and act as) members of a Collective. A collective agent can have roles that are also roles of those agents.
For example, in sociology, a &apos;group action&apos; is the situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group). This can be generalized to the notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as agents.
The difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective. In practice, this difference makes collective agents &apos;less stable&apos; than organizations, because they have a dedicated, publicly recognizable Description that is conceived to introduce them.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on &apos;aspect&apos; (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on &apos;agentivity&apos; (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on &apos;typical participants&apos; (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).
Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.
If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.

(1) Alternative aspectual views

Consider a same event &apos;rock erosion in the Sinni valley&apos;: it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). 
In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).

The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? 
A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin&apos;s aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller&apos;s attitude.
An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a &apos;relational context&apos; created by an observer on the basis of a &apos;frame&apos;. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. 
For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a &apos;theory of accomplishments&apos;. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a &apos;theory of state transitions&apos;.
Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.

(2) Alternative intentionality views

Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.
Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. 
On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. 
Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events&apos; identity.

(3) Alternative participant views

A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. 
For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.
Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer&apos;s choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet &apos;supersenses&apos; for verb synsets).

Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever &apos;true reality&apos; is about, it can&apos;t be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. 
Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements. 

For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&amp;S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer.</rdfs:comment>

Mathematical and logical entities are included in this class: sets, categories, tuples, costants, variables, etc.
Abstract formal entities are distinguished from information objects, which are supposed to be part of a social context, and are localized in space and time, therefore being (social) objects.
For example, the class &apos;Quark&apos; is an abstract formal entity from the purely set-theoretical perspective, but it is an InformationObject from the viewpoint of ontology design, when e.g. implemented in a logical language like OWL.
Abstract formal entities are also distinguished from Concept(s), Collection(s), and Description(s), which are part of a social context, therefore being SocialObject(s) as well.
For example, the class &apos;Quark&apos; is an abstract FormalEntity from the purely set-theoretical perspective, but it is a Concept within history of science and cultural dynamics.

These distinctions allow to represent two different notions of &apos;semantics&apos;: the first one is abstract and formal (&apos;formal semantics&apos;), and formallyInterprets symbols that are about entities whatsoever; for example, the term &apos;Quark&apos; isAbout the Collection of all quarks, and that Collection isFormalGroundingFor the abstract class &apos;Quark&apos; (in the extensional sense). 
The second notion is social, localized in space-time (&apos;social semantics&apos;), and can be used to interpret entities in the intensional sense. For example, the Collection of all quarks isCoveredBy the Concept &apos;Quark&apos;, which is also expressed by the term &apos;Quark&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

Usually, an individual InformationObject would be connected to (at least) an InformationRealization individual.

The realization of an information object also realizes information about itself. This is a special semiotic feature, which allows to avoid a traditonal paradox, by which an information is often supposed to be about itself besides other entities (e.g. the information object &apos;carpe diem&apos; is about its meaning in Horace&apos;s Odes (let alone its fortune in Western culture and beyond), but also about its expression in context: &apos;dum loquimur, fugerit invida aetas: carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero&apos;, with the sound and emotional relations that it could activate.
This is expressed in OWL2 with a local reflexivity axiom of the dul:InformationRealization class.</rdfs:comment>

Therefore, parameters can also be used to constrain regions, e.g. VeryHigh on a subset of values of the Region Height applied to buildings, or to add an external selection criterion , such as measurement units, to regions, e.g. Meter on a subset of values from the Region Length applied to the Region Length applied to roads.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A special kind of Situation that allows to include time indexing for the hasPart relation in situations. 
For example, if a Situation s &apos;finally, my bike has a luggage rack&apos; isSettingFor the entity &apos;my bike&apos; and the TimeIntervals &apos;now&apos;, or more specifically &apos;29March2021&apos;, we need to have a time-index the part relation. With Parthood, we use includesWhole and includesPart properties.
This can be done similarly for other arguments of parthood, e.g. location, configuration, topology, etc.
Concerning the possible property characteristics reused from mereology (transitivity, asymmetry, reflexivity), they need to be implemented by means of rules (or, in a limited way, property chains using the binary hasPart or hasProperPart properties).
A key is also added to ensure identification constraints of time-indexed parthood.</rdfs:comment>

For example, the way the surface of a specific PhysicalObject looks like, or the specific light of a place at a certain time, are examples of Quality, while the encoding of a Quality into e.g. a PhysicalAttribute should be modeled as a Region. 
From the design viewpoint, the Quality-Region distinction is useful only when individual aspects of an Entity are considered in a domain of discourse. 
For example, in an automotive context, it would be irrelevant to consider the aspects of car windows for a specific car, unless the factory wants to check a specific window against design parameters (anomaly detection). 
On the other hand, in an antiques context, the individual aspects for a specific piece of furniture are a major focus of attention, and may constitute the actual added value, because the design parameters for old furniture are often not fixed, and may not be viewed as &apos;anomalies&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

It can also be seen as a &apos;relational context&apos; created by an observer on the basis of a &apos;frame&apos; (i.e. a Description). 
For example, a PlanExecution is a context including some actions executed by agents according to certain parameters and expected tasks to be achieved from a Plan; a DiagnosedSituation is a context of observed entities that is interpreted on the basis of a Diagnosis, etc.
Situation is also able to represent reified n-ary relations, where isSettingFor is the top-level relation for all binary projections of the n-ary relation. 
If used in a transformation pattern for n-ary relations, the designer should take care of adding (some or all) OWL2 keys, corresponding to binary projections of the n-ary, to a subclass of Situation. Otherwise the &apos;identification constraint&apos; (Calvanese et al., IJCAI 2001) might be violated.</rdfs:comment>

For example, reaching a destination is a task that can be executed by performing certain actions, e.g. driving a car, buying a train ticket, etc. 
The actions to execute a task can also be organized according to a Plan that is not the same as the one that defines the task (if any). 
For example, reaching a destination could be defined by a plan to get on holidays, while the plan to execute the task can consist of putting some travels into a sequence.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A transition is a Situation that creates a context for three TimeInterval(s), two additional different Situation(s), one Event, one Process, and at least one Object: the Event is observed as the cause for the transition, one Situation is the state before the transition, the second Situation is the state after the transition, the Process is the invariance under some different transitions (including the one represented here), in which at least one Object is situated. Finally, the time intervals position the situations and the transitional event in time.
This class of situations partly encodes the ontology underlying typical engineering algebras for processes, e.g. Petri Nets. 
A full representation of the transition ontology is outside the expressivity of OWL, because we would need qualified cardinality restrictions,  coreference, property equivalence, and property composition.</rdfs:comment>

BTW, since spoken realizations are a &apos;primary&apos; code of communication, the difference between direct and indirect spoken realizations (reading) should be considered relevant.
A grapheme is not necessarily able to express a meaning (a dul:SocialObject), although it can in principle (e.g. &apos;a&apos; in English).</rdfs:comment>

In the case of natural languages, their components are &apos;temporary&apos; and &apos;reconstructed&apos; out of actual usage. For example, a grammar for a natural language has the status of a theory for that language, and alternative ones can exist (e.g. generative vs. construction grammars).
Another distinction, between the general (systemic) rules for a language, and the local (contextual) rules for e.g. a certain context, speaker, place, etc., can be made separately.
The most comprehensive classification of languages ha probably been made by Umberto Eco, based on the production modes of the &apos;signs&apos; that are represented in a certain language. It uses several semiotic dimensions, and will be modeled in a forthcoming ontology.</rdfs:comment>

Its topological unity can change according to its physical realization: as a written realization, its boundaries are blank spaces, as a spoken realization, sometimes is silence, sometimes not, and higher order features intervene.
Grammatical notions, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., are roles defined by a grammar, and words (or larger linguistic objects) can play those roles in a given language. E.g., the word &apos;share&apos; can play both &apos;verb&apos; and &apos;noun&apos; roles in contemporary English, while the word &apos;come&apos; can only play the &apos;verb&apos; role in English, and the &apos;adverb&apos; or &apos;conjunction&apos; roles in Italian (but if we consider a word as only realized by phonemes, i.e. if we consider the oral realizations of &apos;come&apos;, there is no common word &apos;come&apos; in the two languages).</rdfs:comment>
